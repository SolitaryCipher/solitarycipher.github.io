In previous terms I was working mostly on my own - so I went into eSight hoping that I would be in a team. While that technically happened, my work mostly focuses on an Android app being developed solely by myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android was completely new to me, going into this term. I had previous experience with iOS, and I found android was not a huge leap. Most of the basic concepts are similar, but Android provides some extra libraries for doing background tasks. At the end of my term I had experience designing an Android app from scratch (mostly, I did a full redesign of an existing app) and I now know the basics of development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my projects was to port the eStreamer Android App to iOS. Since I had done a fair amount of iOS programming before I decided to learn Swift. The Language is fairly interesting, taking concepts from Object Oriented and Functional languages. Overall it was easy to learn because of its similarity to Haskell and Objective-C. I hope that with time it becomes the preferred language of more people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though in general I did not achieve the goal of being part of a team, I did make efforts to improve my communication skills. I made sure to keep our bug tracker up-to-date, and I used the same workflow that would be used in a larger team. I even pair-programmed a couple of times! The skills I learned here will help in the future when I must be integrated into a full engineering team, but that's simply something that has not happened in my co-op experience. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
