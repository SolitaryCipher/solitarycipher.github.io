Their headset gives Legally Blind people helpful tools that make their lives easier. There are plenty of stories about &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/blind-12-year-old-sees-mom-time-electronic-glasses-article-1.2618270"&gt;kids seeing their parents for the first time&lt;/a&gt; or even a &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/blind-12-year-old-sees-mom-time-electronic-glasses-article-1.2618270"&gt;second chance to see their own wedding&lt;/a&gt;. While it cannot help blind users drive, it can significantly improve their vision under some circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headset itself mixes Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality together in an attempt to make an immersive experience that accurately represents the real world. It has two displays that the user looks into which show a feed from a front-facing camera. The device will modify the image (zooming, changing contrast, and OCR are just a few examples ) with the intention of making it easier for the user to see. The headset gives users some peripheral vision - allowing people to walk around and perform everyday tasks while wearing the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headset runs a custom version of Android. Even though all the menus and interfaces use Android views under the hood, we had a custom menu system. The custom system allows us to customize the interface as we see fit - which in turn gives the users a lot of options. All the options are necessary because each visual impairment is unique, and each user needs a different set of settings. While Android provides a good framework for apps it lacks some accessibility options eSight users require. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
